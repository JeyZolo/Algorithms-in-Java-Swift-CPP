1. Return all words in the list with the prefix   that user searched for. And without traverse the list every time. 
Ans: Trie

2. You have an array with words. Print them by anagrams groups  
Ans: LC 49. Group Anagrams

3. Given two sparse Vectors, compute the Dot Product.
Ans: a = [a1, a2, ..., an] and b = [b1, b2, ..., bn]
    => a1b1 + a2b2+ ... anbn

4. You have a user-submitted review (basically just a paragraph of 5ish sentences). Design and write an algorithm to break up the review into sentences, and put it in a list/array data structure. (The goal of this question, I think, was to see how you can cleverly figure out how to deal with non-standard punctuation) 
Ans:

6. I was asked to implement a function to take a collection of SET cards and identify a set if it exists or return an error status or something similar if it does not. This is according to the rules of the game "SET" which you should look up for context


7. Design LRU Cache 
Ans: LC 146. LRU Cache

8. Subtract two strings  
Ans: subtract 2 strings.java

9. Given a list of threads with a start time and finish time, determine all the threads with overlapping times
Ans: Collections.sort(threads, (a, b) -> (a.start == b.start ? b.end - a.end : a.start - b.start))

10. Given a string, print true or false if you can create a palindrome with it. 
Ans: ...

11. Create a cache for data on a webpage to avoid calling the server whenever possible.  
Ans: LRU?

How to implement a cache for yelp website. 
Ans: 
 - Proxy Cache
Proxy caches work similarly to the browser cache. The primary differences are that proxy caches are shared caches that serve hundreds to thousands of clients instead of just one. So, if thousands of people visit a site while you are in a session on that same site, their requests won't be sent all the way to the web server. Rather, they will be serviced by the proxy server. The proxy settings can be either set in the preferences tab on your browser or they can be set automatically by the underlying network with intermediaries. Handling the "freshness" of the resource on the proxy server is an entirely different problem, but that challenge is beyond the scope of this article.

 - Gateway Cache (http cache)
Gateway caches are similar to intermediaries, but instead of being deployed by the network administrators to save bandwidth, they are usually managed by webmasters to make their web sites more reliable and scalable.


12. How would you make a Spam detector for Yelp given all the data. Another binary search tree coding question.
Ans: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/91177/machine-learning-techniques-for-spam-detection-and-in-general-for-text-classifi
One basic technique is Naive Bayes, which is often used for spam filtering. Essentially, you look at the frequencies of words appearing in sentences that you have already judged to be spam, and also at the frequencies of those words appearing in sentences you have already judged to be not spam, and then use those frequencies to make a judgement about new sentences.

13. implement regex 
Ans: LC 10. Regular Expression Matching

14. find the sum of two integers represented as strings, return the sum as string, i.e "123" and "456" would return "579". 
Ans: add up two strings

15. How to find the only different number in two unsorted arrays?
Ans: Bit mask

16. How to design a request dispatcher for load balancing ----------------- WTF --------------------
Ans: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-design-a-request-dispatcher-for-load-balancing

17. Write code to generate all possible case combinations of a given lower-cased string. (e.g. "0ab" -&gt; ["0ab", "0aB", "0Ab", "0AB"])  
Ans: back tracking, "aA", "bB"...

18. I only had one coding question that was to find the maximum number of segments that could fit on a number line given a list of segments. 
Ans: DP?

19. given an array of intervals, return max number of non-overlapping intervals  
Ans: LC Intervals questions

20. Longest Palindrome Substring 
Ans: LC 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

21. Split shifted linked list into two sorted lists.  
Ans: ..

22. It is about interval selecting. 
Ans: LC Intervals questions

闲聊：
1. tell me about yourself
2. 介绍一个project
3. 问yelp可以如何改进: 
	1). When I choose delivery, I need to type my address, I think it could be better if it can locate my address automatically. 
	2). There are two search fields. one is in the first tab, the second one is in the second tab. It looks a little bit redundant. And I found that it's actually the same search field, when I typed in the first search field, it shows me the second one, which means it is real redundant. I know the purpose must be to make sure it is very convenient for costumers to search, but at the same time, it maybe cause confusion that people may be confused what's the difference between these two tabs, and they found out that it's actually the same after spending a short time discovery. 
	3). When I try to order some food, it is better to show some comments at the bottom of the order page. 
	4). When I click cancel, I was supposed to return to the prior page, instead of return to the main page. Yes, there is a "back" button in that page, but user's don't know, unless they made a mistake before, normally speaking, that's not good for an app, not an user-oriented design.


Coding:
1. LRU, MRU
