1. Difference between `const char *p` and `char * const p`?

`const char *a;` //the value of the char is const, not allowed to change value 
`*a = 'F';` //illegal: change the const char value 
`a = "Hi";` // legal 

`char* const a;` //the addr of the char is const, not allowed to change addr 
`*a = 'F';` //legal 
`a ="HI";` //illegal, change the addr that's supposed to be const.

2. What is the use of virtual destructors?

   Making base class destructor virtual guarantees that the object of derived class is destructed properly, i.e., both base class and derived class destructors are called.

3.

```c++
char *xyz()
  {
  char str[32];
  strcpy(str, "Hello there!");
  return (str);
  }

void main()
  {
    printf("%s", xyz());
  }
```

It will return a dangling pointer. A garbage value. 
As str variable is in stack which is accessible only in local function xyz(). 

We need to make static to return always hello there:

```c++
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<string.h> 

char *xyz() 
{ 
static char str[32]; 
strcpy(str,"Hello there!"); 
return(str); 
} 

void main() 
{ 
printf("%s",xyz()); 
}
```

4. Have you overloaded operator new? I said yes, than Y did u do that?

5. How will you overload << operator for output? Why you have to make it friend?

   Becoz, the leftmost operand in overloading << operator should be ostream& , while in member function the leftmost operand is implicitly *this pointer of class.

6. What are problems with shallow copy? 

   Problem: We have *two* objects both containing pointers to the same buffer. When one of them gets destroyed, it deletes the associated buffer for the data. Then we have a dangling pointer -- it's still trying to refer to the buffer, but the buffer no longer exists. When the second object gets destroyed, it'll try to free the same memory again -- but since it's already been freed, that leads to undefined behavior

   Using `copy constructor` to create an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. 

7. What happen if I delete "this" in member function? Can you call member functions after doing this?

   You can `delete this;` but it's generally speaking an extremely bad idea, and once it's done, you cannot touch any member variables or member functions.

   **As long as you're careful, it's OK for an object to commit suicide (delete this).**

   Here's how I define "careful":

   - You must be absolutely 100% positively sure that this object was allocated via new (not by new[], nor by placement new, nor a local object on the stack, nor a global, nor a member of another object; but by plain ordinary new).
   - You must be absolutely 100% positively sure that your member function will be the last member function invoked on this object.
   - **You must be absolutely 100% positively sure that the rest of your member function (after the delete this line) doesn't touch any piece of this object (including calling any other member functions or touching any data members).**
   - You must be absolutely 100% positively sure that no one even touches the this pointer itself after the delete this line. In other words, you must not examine it, compare it with another pointer, compare it with NULL, print it, cast it, do anything with it.

8. You are given an array which consist of number between 0 to 5 digit range, write a function which will return true or false, if array can be divided into 2 half such that sum of the two half would be equal?

```java
public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            sum += n;
        }
        if (sum % 2 != 0) return false;
        sum >>= 1;
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[sum + 1];
        dp[0] = true;
        for (int n : nums) {
            for (int j = sum; j >= n; j--) {
                dp[j] = dp[j] | dp[j - n];
            }
        }
        return dp[sum];
    }
```

9. Do u know STL (Standard Template Library),  tell me what kind of containers are available, complexity of each?

**Sequence Containers**

- std::**vector**, std::**deque**, std::**array**, std::**list**, std::**forward_list**, and std::**basic_string**

**Associative Containers**

- set, multiset, map, multimap

**Container Adapters**

- **stack**, **queue**, **priority queue**

10.  You are given a file, how will u find perticular string in the file? 

    Below is `KMP` algorithm

```java
public static String KMP(String text, String pattern) {
        int n = text.length(), m = pattern.length();
        int[] table = buildTable(m, pattern);
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            if (pattern.charAt(j) == text.charAt(i)) {
                i++;
                j++;
                if (j == m) {
                    int l = i - 1, r = i;
                    while (l >= 0 && text.charAt(l) != ' ') l--;
                    while (r < n && text.charAt(r) != ' ') r++;
                    return text.substring(l + 1, r);
                }
            } else if (j > 0) j = table[j];
            else i++;
        }
        return "";
    }

    private static int[] buildTable(int m, String pat) {
        int[] table = new int[m];
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < pat.length(); i++) {
            if (pat.charAt(i) == pat.charAt(j)) {
                table[i] = ++j;
            } else {
                while (j > 0 && pat.charAt(j) != pat.charAt(i)) {
                    j = table[j - 1];
                }
                if (pat.charAt(j) == pat.charAt(i)) {
                    table[i] = ++j;
                }
            }
        }
        return table;
    }
```

11.  You are given an array which contains either 1 or 0, and they are in sorted order Ex. a[] = {1,1 ,1 ,1 ,1, 0,0,0,0,0 }; How will you count # of 1's and 0's?

    Ans: Binary Search

12.  A class contains 2 float and 1 double, what will be size of object? Now that class contains 2 floats and static double what will be size? Reasons?

    Now it contains all static vars waht will be size? Why not zero?

Ans: Generally size of float is 4 bytes and size of double is 8 bytes. so Size of object will be 16 bytes. 
if a static double, then size will be 8 bytes because static variables are not allocated on stack. they are global for class. 
If all member variables are static then size will be 1 byte not zero because an object should have an address to show its existence....

13. What is optimization flag? Have u used it? What does it do?

Ans: Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

14. What is Volatile keyword? What happen when u use it? (Expected Ans was compiler puts it into register and hence no optimization )

Ans:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4437527/why-do-we-use-volatile-keyword-in-c

Volatile variables tells the compiler that this variable has the tendency to change , may be changed from another file, so should not be optimized by putting such variables in cache. Whenever this variable is accessed to retrieve its value.It has to be accecesed freshly, There are higher chances that this variable might have been changed by some other process or hardware. 

15. What is core dump? Why would you get one? Who generates it?

Ans: Core dump is a binary file with the state (stack pointer, program counter, register values) of execution just before crashing. Some of the reasons for getting a core dump are violation of segments, sudden abort etc., The OS generates the core.
