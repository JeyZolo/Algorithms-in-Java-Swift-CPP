#Basic Algorithms
This is a self-traning project, implementing some basic algorithms with C++. I am planing to implement Huffman encoding, (quick, merge, heap, shell) sort and hashmap in C++ for now. Huffman encoding is heavily influenced by [Sophia Zhang](http://blog.csdn.net/abcjennifer/article/details/8020695).

## Language
* C++
* I will do some exercise with _Swift_ in the near future.

## Intention
* strengthen my basic algorithm knowledge
* enhance coding skills, especially in *C++* and *Swift*
